name: pixelmator
description: Build logos, icons, simple graphics and shape-layer paintings of any photo live inside Pixelmator Pro on this Mac from a JSON spec (shapes, text, colors, strokes), then export PNG/JPG/SVG/PDF/PXD and verify the result. Use when the user asks to make, draw, design or recreate a logo, icon, badge or wordmark "in Pixelmator", wants to watch it being built in the app, or wants to run AppleScript against Pixelmator Pro with readable errors.

# pixelmator

Describe an image. Watch Pixelmator Pro build it, layer by layer. Get a file and an editable document.

Everything goes through one script. It validates the spec, writes the AppleScript, runs it,
decodes any error, then checks the app really built what was asked.

```bash
PXM=~/.claude/skills/pixelmator/pxm.py
python3 $PXM check                       # once per session. Is the app there, is permission granted?
python3 $PXM logo spec.json              # build it on screen, leave the document open
python3 $PXM logo spec.json --headless   # same build in the background, document closed after export
python3 $PXM logo spec.json --gif ~/Downloads/build.gif   # plus a 2 second GIF of it being built, layer by layer
python3 $PXM logo spec.json --dry-run    # print the AppleScript only
python3 $PXM paint photo.jpg --out ~/Downloads/painting.png --shapes 3000   # rebuild any image from shape layers
python3 $PXM run script.applescript      # anything the spec can't do, with decoded errors
```

## Workflow

1. Write the spec to a file. Canvas first, then layers from bottom to top.
2. Run `logo`. Exit 0 means built, exported and verified.
3. Read the exported PNG with the Read tool. Judge it like a designer. Fix the spec, run again.
4. Exit 2 lists every bad key at once. Fix them all in one pass.

## Spec

```json
{
  "width": 1024, "height": 1024,
  "background": "#FFFFFF",
  "layers": [
    {"type": "rounded_rectangle", "width": 880, "height": 880, "corner_radius": 200, "fill": "#14181F"},
    {"type": "ellipse", "width": 640, "height": 640, "stroke": "#F2B33D", "stroke_width": 28},
    {"type": "text", "text": "JB", "font": "HelveticaNeue-Bold", "size": 300, "color": "#FFFFFF"}
  ],
  "export": ["~/Downloads/logo.png", "~/Downloads/logo.svg"],
  "keep_open": true
}
```

- Leave out `background` for a transparent PNG.
- Layer types: `rectangle`, `rounded_rectangle` (`corner_radius`), `ellipse`, `polygon` (`sides` 3-11),
  `star` (`points` 3-20, `radius` 10-100), `line`, `text` (`text`, `font`, `size`, `color`).
- `cutout` draws curves without a pen tool. `ops` is a list of ovals and rectangles (`shape`: `ellipse` or `rectangle`, whole-pixel `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` in canvas coordinates) combined with `op`: `add`, `subtract` or `intersect`. The result becomes one vector shape. A crescent is an oval minus an oval. A leaf is two circles intersected. See `examples/apple.json`, `nike.json`, `nvidia.json`.
- Every layer takes `x`, `y` (top-left corner in pixels, or `"center"`, the default), `name`, `opacity` 0-100, `rotation` 0-359.9 in degrees, counterclockwise (so 350 tilts a layer 10 degrees clockwise).
- `cx`, `cy` place a layer by its center instead. Use them for text, whose size is only known inside the app. Text on a curve is one text layer per letter, each with `cx`, `cy` and `rotation`.
- Shapes take `width`, `height`, `fill`, `stroke`, `stroke_width`. No fill means outline only.
- Colors are `#RRGGBB`. Export format comes from the extension: png jpg tiff heic webp svg pdf psd pxd.
- Fonts: PostScript names are safest (`HelveticaNeue-Bold`). An unknown font fails the run. Pixelmator would have swapped in Helvetica without a word.

## Paint

`paint` turns any image into thousands of flat shape layers. No LLM is involved and no tokens are spent while it builds. It is a quadtree: start with one rectangle in the average color, split the cell with the most color error into four, repeat until the layer budget is gone. Detail lands where the picture needs it. Parents stay under their children, so the picture sharpens as it builds.

```bash
python3 $PXM paint mona.jpg --out mona.png --shapes 3000 --headless --gif mona.gif
```

Add `--engine magick` to draw the same plan with ImageMagick instead of Pixelmator: no app, no layers to open, 40000 squares in about a second. `--shapes 40000 --detail 1024 --size 2048` gives a crisp painting. Pixelmator stays the way to watch it build and to get real layers; `--gif` and `--frames` need it.

- `--shapes` is the layer budget (default 2000). `--detail` is the sampling grid (default 256). `--size` is the canvas. `--shape ellipse` gives a pointillist look.
- `--out` repeats: `--out a.png --out a.pxd`.
- Speed: about 10 layers a second, slower as the document fills. 3000 layers is roughly ten minutes. Start it with `run_in_background` and wait for the notification. Do not poll.
- The GIF takes about 60 frames however many layers there are.
- Reference images must be yours or public domain.

## Text on a curve

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/pixelmator/arc_text.py "Great Service" --font Palatino-Bold --size 88 \
    --cx 1024 --cy 414 --a 1000 --b 344 > letters.json
```

It measures each letter in the real app, spaces them by arc length along the top of the ellipse, tilts each to the tangent, and prints layers to paste into the spec. `--offset` slides the text along the arc.

## Shape recipes

All from `cutout` ops. Real examples sit in `examples/`.

- Crescent or swoosh: oval, subtract a shifted oval, then `rotation` (nike.json).
- Leaf or almond eye: two big circles intersected (apple.json, nvidia.json).
- Ring: oval, subtract a smaller oval. Or stack a white oval on a colored one.
- Arch: tall oval ring, intersect a rectangle to cut it off flat (mcdonalds.json).
- Bite: subtract a circle from the edge (apple.json).
- Two-tone split: build the shape twice, each intersected with a rectangle on one side (nvidia.json).
- Overlap color: intersect the two circles as a third layer (mastercard.json).

## Learned the hard way

- Builds are serialized by a file-based lock. If another build is running, the command fails with "Pixelmator Pro is busy: <holder>". Pass `--wait` to queue behind it instead.
- Rotation is counterclockwise. Get it backwards on curved text and every letter leans the wrong way. It reads as "crooked", not as "rotated wrong".
- Judge text from a zoomed crop, never the whole image. `ffmpeg -i logo.png -vf crop=1000:230:300:20 crop.png`, then Read it.
- Compare against the reference side by side before calling a recreation done. Fix the biggest visible difference first.
- A text box is wider than its letters by a fixed padding. Measure, never guess widths.
- Unknown fonts fall back to Helvetica with no error. The verify step catches it. Use PostScript names.
- A new document holds one blank layer. It can only be deleted after another layer exists. The script handles it.
- Shape geometry (corner radius, sides, star points) is read-only after `make`.
- Exporting into a folder that does not exist fails with -100. The script makes folders first.
- GIFs of flat logos: no dithering, one palette for the whole clip. Dithering is what makes text look dirty.
- Shapes with a numeric `x` and `y` are placed inside `make`, not with a second `set position`. One less round-trip per layer. Give numbers when you have them.
- A headless build takes about six seconds. So iterate: build, Read the PNG, fix the spec, build again.
- Run `uvx ruff check .` and the tests before pushing. CI will fail the push otherwise.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning | Do this |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Built, exported, verified | Look at the image |
| 2 | Bad spec or arguments | Fix the keys it lists |
| 3 | Mac not ready: app missing, Automation permission denied | Follow the hint, ask the user to grant permission |
| 4 | Pixelmator refused a step | Error names the layer and the AppleScript number |
| 5 | Ran, but the result is wrong: layer count, font fallback, export size | Do not ship the file |

## Beyond the spec

Gradients, effects, masks, remove background, image layers: write AppleScript and use `run`.
The dictionary is the source of truth: `sdef "/Applications/Pixelmator Pro.app"`.
Colors there are 0-65535 per channel. Shape geometry is read-only after `make`.
There is no brush, pen or path command. Build from shapes, cutouts and text.
Never script System Events to click through the UI.

## Tests

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/pixelmator   # a symlink to ~/Documents/Code/pixelmator-skill
python3 -m unittest -v               # unit tests, no app needed. CI runs these on every push
PXM_LIVE=1 python3 -m unittest -v    # also drives the real app
```
